Off the Racks is an application designed to help people plan their daily outfits

# General Information
***
This project is geared to help people who want to shorten their time in the morning 
finding an outfit, want to rotate through the clothes they may not wear as often,
finding new trends, or anything other needs not specifiec.
***
The project status is finalized for the semester. For future plans, I would want
to install the weather app, sync with the devices calendar, and implement
a recommendation engine.
